**Turbine Component Failures**   
  
1. 🔧 Goal: Predict failures in wind turbine components using sensor and operational data to enable proactive maintenance and reduce downtime.  
  
2. 📊 Approach: Collected and preprocessed time-series data, performed exploratory data analysis (EDA), and engineered features to reveal patterns and early fault indicators.  
  
3 .⚡ Impact: Improved reliability, reduced maintenance costs, and increased energy efficiency by identifying failure trends and environmental influences on turbine performance.  

---

The objective of this project is to develop a predictive maintenance system for wind turbines using sensor and operational data. By analyzing patterns, anomalies, and failure trends, the goal is to anticipate component breakdowns in advance, reduce unplanned downtime, optimize maintenance schedules, and enhance the overall efficiency of renewable energy systems.  

### Getting Started 🐢

 Just going through a certain steps, you can easily begin with your work!  
 Have a glimpse below:  

 1. **Grab the Data:**  
 Collected time-series sensor data, maintenance logs, and environmental information from multiple wind turbines..  
 

 2. **Code Parallelly**  
 Team members worked on data cleaning, feature engineering, and EDA simultaneously to speed up development and ensure modular progress.  

 3. **Add Visualizations**  
Created plots like heatmaps, trend graphs, and boxplots to uncover patterns, detect anomalies, and compare healthy vs. faulty components.  

 4. **Work Independently**  
 Each member handled specific tasks (e.g., preprocessing, EDA, modeling) independently while maintaining collaborative checkpoints for integration and review.
